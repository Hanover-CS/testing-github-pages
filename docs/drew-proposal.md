## NFL Box Score Recap
### Main Features
This android application will allow NFL football enthusiasts to have access to information on all games that have already been played.
Not everyone has access to tv networks that show the football games they want to watch, or maybe they are just too busy at the time, so a much easier way is to get
end-of-game stats all on your mobile device. Many people enjoy fantasy football or just keeping up to date on what happens in the NFL,
so this app will give all the stats for you right at your finger tips.

First you will pick the team you would like to view. After that, their entire schedule will be shown for you to pick the game and view the final box score.
With box score you will have access to to the score of the game, offensive stats, defensive stats, and any other touchdowns from special teams.
Offensive stats will show individual player's and their yardages/touchdowns, while defensive stats will show player's tackles, interceptions, sacks or any other major plays.
These stats become available only after a game has been finished, so if you are unable to watch the game or would like to recap on a game from weeks before.
In particular fantasy football players will be available to make calculated rosters and trades all by viewing these box scores. 
This app will be very easy to access and traverse to find what your looking for.
