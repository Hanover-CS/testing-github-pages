# Super Gorilla Weightlifting

**Project Idea:**

This app will be created with the vision that anybody that wants to lift will be able to use this 
app. I want this app to cater to beginner lifters all the way through to advanced lifters. I hope 
to make the app easy to use and reliable for the users. The app will allow users to choose the 
lifting path that they want to follow like powerlifting, crossfit, weight loss, etc.

**Main Features:**

When researching other weightlifting apps I came across a feature that was used by one app that I 
really want to include in my app. That is adding helpful tips besides the lift the user is doing at 
that time to help them maintain and keep good form throughout the entire lifting motion. This will 
be especially helpful to lifters that are just beginning their weight training and will lower the 
chances of them getting hurt during a lift. A feature that almost comes with every lifting app is 
the ability to track your progress as much as you would like. This is a feature that I would also 
like to add in with my app, I like the idea that users will be able to track what they do for each 
workout so they would be able to make more progress. I also want to add a feature that at the start 
of the app you choose the path you desire and you also put your max weights for some of the main 
lifts. This will allow the app to show the user what weight they should use during the lifting 
sessions to insure progress. Based on what lifting journey the user uses the app will give them 
monthly workouts they can use for however long they would like. 

**Similar Solutions:**

There is an app called [PH3 Powerlifting][1] that is used by many power lifters that would like 
to compete in competitions. This app is set for a 13 week lifting cycle that gives you specific 
workouts and goals to gain strength.This is why many advance lifters will use this app because it 
is specifically created for them. That is where my app would be different, I want my app to be used 
by all and for the app to have many different lifting options to choose from. What I like most 
about this app is the simplicity behind it and that it barely runs with any glitches connected with 
it. Having a smooth running app is something I will be shooting for when creating my app because I 
believe that is what user want.

Another app that is being used is called [Alpha Progression App][2]. The Alpha Progression App is 
and app that allows the user to track their lifting progression through a certain time period that 
they choose. This app closely compares to what I would like to do with my app in terms of user 
being able to track their weightlifting progression. I wan to be able to add spots where lifters 
can put the weight they do after each set and be able to save the data so the user can go back and 
see what they did previously and have the chance to add extra weight if they would like. Something 
this app has that is really different than mine is that the user can put in different equipment 
that they have available to them and the A.I. will generate workouts according to that based on 
what they have available.

[Strong][3] is another weightlifting app that caters to more advanced lifters. The app allows for 
people to keep track of their best sets, max 1RM, body fat percentage and more. The app is somewhat 
like a notebook, it allows you to make notes about your lifts and what happens with your weight you 
use. With the "notebook" feature user are free to have more custom experience when using the app. 
This is a version of what I would like to do with my app, I would like my app to allow the users to 
track and write what they did for each set. The strong app is more open in terms of the lifting 
experience but being able to make notes for your lifts and how they went is a different style that 
I have seen from other lifting apps and it is something I want to look more into.

[Tempo Move][4] is a very advanced workout app when it comes to tracking your weight and being 
able to get helpful tips and more ideas from other trainers. This app comes with trackable 
dumbbells and they are also going to have trackable barbells. The app also has a massive library 
of on-demand and live workouts for the user to use and have access to. Tempo Move uses the camera 
on your iphone to monitor and track your movements, helping to provide advice and insights on your 
workouts. I have never really seen an app that has built in live workouts that users can follow 
along with while the app simultaneously is able to track your dumbbells and barbells to make sure 
your form is correct and that you are doing the correct movements. This app would easily be great 
for new users and even advanced users because of the built in tracking that will help people become 
better lifters and would eliminate possible injuries that could arise. Having trackable dumbbells 
and barbells would benefit my app if I was able to make it that way because it would allow 
beginners or lifters trying to compete track and see how they are moving their lifts and they 
could plan accordingly to improve.
