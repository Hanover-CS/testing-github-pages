## Random Lance Generator for BattleTech

<p>this desktop app is a program that will randomly generate a lance/star (a force of 4/5 mechs) 
according to the rules of battle tech and a variety of parameters. Battle tech is not a very competitively
oriented war-game. Instead battle tech is typically played rather casually or in as part of narrative campaigns or RPG's.
As such a means to randomly generate a fore is useful as it allows for combat encounters to be easily created
or to facilitate novel scenario for those involved would not have considered. 
</p>

### Main Features
<p>There is only one main feature and that is of course the random generation of list. this randomisation
will be governed by a few factors such as: Specified Faction, Time period, and battle value. in addition
since it is a desktop app it doesn't need wifi which stands in contrast to the competitors. i would also
like to have a very clean, simple and user friendly interface. </p>

### Alternate Solutions 
<p> [1] Is a webapp that has most of the feature I want mine to have, with some issues: it has very 
few options for time period,and is is rather unintuitive to use. meaning that while I can use to generate a force, 
I never feel that I know why it is making that list in particular.
</p>

<p>[2] is another webb app that has options for two variants of Battletech but lacks any way to specify a time
period and is lacking most of the factions. it is however easier to use than [1]  </p>

<p> There are already a few and i mean literally a few random lance 
generator for Battletech, [1] the first is most similar to my idea, it has most of the 
feature that I want the only problem is that there is a very limited range of time to select from. 
the outhers are similar story with as they are both lacking more and more features. for example [2] has neither time 
period selection nor most of the factions and [3] dosnt serve the same purpose as my ideas. </p>
